# My Backstory and The Journey head

## Who Am I

My name is not important, but I am a hardworking hamster running all day in the daily hamster wheel. My current job is in the financial industry and satisfies me to a certain degree as they  pay me well. My passion is creating, coding and building. One might say I am a worker by day and a hacker by night.

Why didn't you already quit your job, if you are not fully satisfied with it? The answer is simple, I am a father and have a family that I have to support. My current position gives me and my family a good life and security. Until on day one might decide that they need to replace me. You can often read in newspapers about this scenarios as this phenomenon is often the case within financial institutions.

I know I can do better. How do you know this, you might ask. I am not one of those typical workers, I have a technical background and I love to create. Deep inside me I have the feeling that I can reach financial freedom for me and my family and secure our future. Furthermore, it is also my passion to code and work on product ideas and bring these ideas to live.

The goal of this blog is to document my journey and share my progress with the world. In return I am happy if you send me your feedback and suggestions. I love to talk to likeminded folks!


## My goals

I have 1 big goal in mind that I want to reach: 

> Start a sizeable business that returns net profits of 10k per month.

There are certain limits to this goal:

1. As I do not want to quit my job I want to start this business on the side, **without taking any outside funding**. 
2. Furthermore, I am having **limited time** everyday. (need to take care of my family!) So I will automate as much as possible.
3. I will try to take the **shortest path** possible to reach my goal.

## Why start a side-business, when you have a fulltime job?

You might say at this point: "You work at a financial institution, I guess you have a stressful job. Why are you doing this? Enjoy life and see what is coming next? Everything will turn out fine". 

Sure ;)... Ok to be honest, since I studied Computer Science it was always my goal to have my own internet business. It just happened that I landed at this job and from there my responsibilities grew. Doing this is also in a way fulfilling my dream.

## How to achieve this plan?

There are several ways how to tackle this plan. There are several founders that achieved this goal already such as Vincent Woo with [coderpad.com](coderpad.com), Allen Wong (@regoapps) or even Robert Gryn [voluum.com](voluum.com).

My learning from them are:

1. Choose a large market
2. Monetize as early as possible
3. Do not program until you have people that are interested in your product

## What are your available resources?

My available resources are the following: I am having a von server that runs on linux and I can code whatever use case is needed. If a use case is more difficult it might take more time, but from a technical side I can deliver it.

My main premise is to find customers and provide so much value that they need the product and need to pay.

## How much money should you consider to invest?

To be honest my investment is minimal. I have a VPS that costs me around 10$ per month. 

If you have the technical skills it is even cheaper for you to start an online business as you could use existing services. I expect that in the beginning I will need a landing page and a way to capture email addresses. I won't create a fully working product until I have interested customers that want this product.

It is very cheap to start an online business, but as every business it does not run itself and requires time. I will definitely outsource certain tasks after I have a few paying customers. Platforms such as upwork or freelancer.com are perfect places to hire programmers that can build features that I will specify.
